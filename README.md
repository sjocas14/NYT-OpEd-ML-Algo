# NYT-OpEd-ML-Algo

A two-part algorithm that 1)takes in a list of New York Times columnists and uses BeautifulSoup to scrape all of the webpage text from their articles into a pandas dataframe and 2) uses the pandas dataframe from the previous program to train itself to recognize the writing of each columnist (using an ML sentiment anayzer using scikit-learn), which then allows the user to input new article text, for which the program spits out a prediction for who the author is based on its training dataset. 

This project will be built out in several different versions, hopefully each one creating an easier user experience and also generating more accurate predictions.
